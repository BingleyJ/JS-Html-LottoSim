# JS-Html-LottoSim


So my mom buys these tickets every week. (My guestimate is @ $1.00/week To win > .. OMG JUST GO TO VEGAS AND THROW YOUR SAVINGS ON BLACK.) They have 5 numbers on them with an extra bonus number. I tell her it's a tool of the man and she should quit. As life is I'm trying to be a super noob-tube at HTML/CSS/JS. Decided to make a simple simulator to maybe show her how many millions she would need to spend in order to re-coup. Alas the lottery isn't like lightening, it is unlikely to strike twice. Ever. Never.
